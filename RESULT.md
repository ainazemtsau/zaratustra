# Core v0.1 Stage 2 domain foundation

## outcome

The owner-authorized Stage 2 implementation is ready for manual acceptance on
`codex/core-v0.1`, based on exact commit
`7ec6033d234b0e2e870f53796a9dad0711d3b468`. It implements an independent
`zaratustra.foundation` package and stops at the requested subject foundation. It
does not read, migrate or write the old `.zara` workspace and does not modify the
separate `C:\projects\zaratustra` checkout.

The foundation provides a new empty space identity and schema; exact immutable
Artifact revisions and provenance; versioned Decision and Grant records; current
Decision/Grant admission; one atomic operation/audit/receipt path; exact replay,
conflict and stale-revision behavior; separately authorized inspection and receipt
reads; verified backup; quarantined restore with execution-epoch rotation; fresh
recovery; terminal logical deletion; and physical cleanup of managed live and backup
payloads. No successor Activity/Work execution layer was admitted.

Implementation commits are `9df390a` (foundation), `f5159fb` (terminal deletion and
backup/delete race closure), and `8a62bdd` (crash-consistent backup publication).

## evidence

The implementation is grounded in specification file
`Zaratustra_Core_Specification_v0.1.md`, SHA-256
`1DDCBF9DBFD58426781F61A67A170D3CE85FCD2BA27B17549773ED3356F9428D`.
`docs/core-v0.1/STAGE2-PLAN.md` records the admitted plan and
`docs/core-v0.1/STAGE2-IMPLEMENTATION.md` records the actual contracts, operations,
storage and reproduction boundary.

The runtime gate accepts Python `3.13.7`, exact SQLite `3.53.3` and FTS5. The
development run used the official Stage 1 archive identity
`3a494861ce24d1f330efbc6c3fb58ce4972f2cf8df4e43122246ed987109dc8a`
(SHA3-256) and extracted DLL identity
`79FD9EC89DBA3F8BD64529A2CA8E9DDE6AE6EDC486C55A1D3F1CE77975A8375C`
(SHA-256). The DLL is admitted per process through `ZARATUSTRA_SQLITE_DLL`; it is
not vendored, downloaded by product code or installed globally.

The model-free synthetic probe at `_scratch/stage2-foundation-probe-b` passed on
SQLite `3.53.3`. It demonstrated exact replay, exact historical/current bytes,
receipt recovery, a verified backup, quarantine-only restore, epoch rotation from 1
to 2, fresh recovery and exact restored bytes. It made no model, provider, network or
old-workspace call.

Twenty focused foundation tests pass. They cover new/reopened spaces, unsupported
runtime/schema refusal, exact binary/text revisions, provenance, replay/conflict,
stale writes, current Decision/Grant behavior, atomic rollback, response recovery,
concurrency, tamper refusal, quarantine/recovery, terminal deletion, backup/delete
interleaving and both backup publication crash windows. In particular, a renamed
package remains non-restorable before inventory commit and becomes verifiably
complete immediately after commit.

The final full `uv run --locked python -m tools.check --deliver` run passed: 168
files were format-clean, Ruff was clean, strict mypy passed across 144 source files,
all 20 import contracts were kept, all 470 tests passed, source and wheel artifacts
built, and delivery-report structure passed. Wheel inspection confirms the
foundation package is installed while development tools remain excluded.

The required bounded setup evaluator found no setup blocker. Independent adversarial
review first found two Critical defects (deleted-record resurrection and a
backup/delete publication race) and then one Important inventory/publication crash
window. Commits `f5159fb` and `8a62bdd` fixed them with deterministic regression
tests. Final bounded re-review found no Critical or Important issue and returned
ready. This review is engineering evidence, not owner acceptance or a Direction G5
artifact.

## assumptions

Trusted-local authority is established by an adapter outside model/request content,
then bound to the resolved space path, space id and execution epoch. This stage
implements and tests that seam but does not choose the future UI, OS identity or
interactive confirmation adapter.

SQLite `3.53.3` remains an exact build requirement for WAL-backed foundation spaces.
The ordinary managed Python runtime's SQLite `3.50.4` is intentionally refused; a
deployment must supply the already verified build or another owner-approved exact
distribution mechanism without weakening runtime admission.

The deletion claim covers files managed by this stage: the live Core database and
its WAL/SHM plus registered managed backup packages. SSD remapping, OS snapshots,
manually copied packages and external systems are outside the claim. Audit keeps
permitted identifiers and outcome references, but managed payload, payload digest,
provenance and replayable payload-derived receipt intent are removed.

## cuts

There is no Activity/Work runtime, Attempt, scheduler, dispatcher, outbox, memory,
Sleep, Pi integration, DBOS dependency, model router, CLI workflow, installer,
updater, migration from old `.zara`, remote publication, CI/CD, GitHub Action or push
notification. No real personal data, paid service or new external right was used.

DBOS remains an open technical question rather than a selected dependency. Its Stage
1 Windows closed-handle sanitation evidence is still inconclusive; this stage neither
silently narrows deletion semantics nor introduces a custom dispatcher.

## cost

The installed change is one independent Python package, one strict SQLite schema and
its tests/docs/probe. New workspace state exists only under a user-selected empty
directory. Test/probe outputs and the verified SQLite runtime remain in ignored local
scratch space. No external service cost was incurred.

## manual-acceptance

The owner explicitly authorized Stage 2 planning, implementation, local commits and
the foundation-only boundary. Automated checks and review establish the engineering
evidence above; they do not declare owner acceptance. The owner should decide whether
this Stage 2 foundation is accepted before authorizing any successor stage.

## recommendation

Keep `zaratustra.foundation` as the sole subject-state authority and preserve its
public module boundary. For a successor, first obtain a separate owner CALL that
defines the smallest Activity/Work contract consuming this foundation. Do not bind
that work to DBOS until the open Windows deletion/handle gate is resolved, and do not
add a replacement dispatcher merely to bypass that gate.
